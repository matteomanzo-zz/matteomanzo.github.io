<div class="entry-content"><p>Learn by doing it&rsquo;s our motto at Makers Academy!
For those who might ask what Makers Academy is.. Well, in the first instance I would say that it&rsquo;s a 12 weeks full immersive web development course where, starting from scratch, you learn how to build a web application in different programming languages, using an impressive variety of tools like databases, frameworks, APIs, etc.. To create real projects all together.
Technically this is correct, but it&rsquo;s not all!
As Sam, our Head of Education, always said at the beginning: &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t be just a technical journey, in fact, it will be more an EMOTIONAL journey..&rdquo; and I totally agree with him.
The best way to consolidate your knowledge is to teach, the best way to learn.. It&rsquo;s learning together! I&rsquo;ll come back to this point in few paragraphs..
Before I started the course I was only able to play games with the computer, write documents, send emails and crash most of the stuff that was in my laptop. So I was quite scared on the first day of the pre-course, (which is an incredibly useful part of the course, structured in four weeks to help you being confident with the tools that will become your fork and knife, like the command-line, git..) but soon I&rsquo;ve started to enjoy typing in that black box and writing VERY easy programs in Ruby, like printing the string &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; or even make very sophisticated calcs like &ldquo;2 + (3 * 4)&rdquo; and see the result printend on my terminal&hellip;
Then, suddenly, the first day of the real course has arrived..
Everyone looked scary and nervous, but after one hour of introducing ourselves, a few chats and setting ourselves comfortable, we started to pair program.. And I understood the magic.
I was pairing with Jacob, trying to recreate the Boris Bikes system, and we had such an amount of issues in the program and in the machine (we learnt a lot by deleting very important files from the laptop, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it to anyone, and neither do Jacob) that we started laughing and try to co-operate to fix as many issues as we could, and it was lots of fun!
If you program by yourself you will learn not even half of the things that you will learn if you pair with someone, and that someone it could be anyone! Yes, because even if your partner has less experience than you, he will try to learn the things that he doesn&rsquo;t know, and you will be explaining
him things that you already know (or you think you knew) and you might find out that you had some lacks.. So you&rsquo;re learning together.
Makers it&rsquo;s all about this, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s emotional. You pair with different people every week or even every day, and it&rsquo;s great! I love teamwork, and I love stay with people, and I&rsquo;ve got the feeling that these guys who I&rsquo;m working with are not anymore classmates or coaches or assistants, but we all starting to be good friends, like a big family!</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to do some coding, but if you didn&rsquo;t put my blog on the trash yet, then check it again in the next days because I will be writing more about the journey..</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
